## Project Overview
This is a tool to enable researchers to quickly deploy automated metric tracking tooling to provide instant observability in autoscaling and other services. It offers three different deployment paradigms: 

1) Local Docker deployment
2) Local Kubernetes deployment using minikube
3) Distributed Kubernetes deployment 

Metrics are tracked using cAdvisor, kube-state-metrics, Prometheus, and Grafana. Each subdirectory provides further explanation in their READMEs to quickly onboard observability tools.
